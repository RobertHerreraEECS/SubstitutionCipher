*********************************************************
*
*       Substitution Cipher C Program
*
*       created by: Robert Herrera / Brandon Radosevich

**********************************************************

- There are two main functionalites that can be used within
 the program. You may either invoke and automatic decryption
 process where frequency analysis used to create an initial key
 and permute through the key comparing to a dictionary, or you 
 may use enter your own key to generate a corresponding deciphered
 text.


 The final Resulting key that can be used to completely decrypt
 the ciphertext is as follows:

   HTYAPJGNEUKFMSCBZVLWRDQXOI
   ETAOINSHRDLCUMWFGYPBVKJXQZ
 
 Within key entrance functionality copy and paste the top row of cipher
 letter ordering into the field from the above key.

                     PROGRAM USE
***************************************************************

   // NOTE: ciphertext has been hard coded into program


   // Resulting Frequency Mapping can be seen on both functions

    Auto-Decrypt (Appx. 5 minute decrytion time)
   ---------------------------------------------
    make
    ./sub_cipher -s 


   - After attempt at decrytion you may manually 
    swap any two letter within the ciphertext. The
    mapped cipher ordering will automatically swap 
    in the background. 
    (i.e.)

    Hi Hellx Hxw are yxu dxing txday?
    
    swap:x,o
   
    Hi Hello How are you doing today?




    User Entered Key (Type or Copy/Paste Ordering)
   ---------------------------------------------
    make
    ./sub_cipher -g
